# FANTASTIC README FILE


## ðŸ¤” Why This Awesome README File?

This is naturally only because i want to impress everyone who are seeing this for starters. I usually don't make such a big deal out of a small task. Feel free to check me out on [facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [instagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to get to know me better.

For real this time. This repository contains the files I use to practice on and works very much like a test
repository. So for the most part it will contain different problems og tasks given in IS-105.
